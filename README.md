# me-pace-ga-diary

An app designed to make it easier to track your activity.

This is designed with ME sufferers in mind, and is intended to be used as part of a Pacing and Graded Activity programme.

This is written using re-natal, a ReactNative wrapper for ClojureScript. The choice of language and frameworks is intended to force some adherence to good practices, as I find it much harder to just hack a solution that somehow works in Clojure than JavaScript, and I want this to be useful to as many people as possible, rather than just fellow Android users.

## Usage

This is intended to be published to relevent app stores, and so is not intended as a consumable package.

## Support

Currently this is very much a work in early progress, I'm still working out how I want things to work and how to implement things using unfamiliar libraries, and so is completely unsupported - at some later point I shall declare alpha, and then be happy to take feedback.
